Unit 7: Project 1

Welding Worklist

Description

An application used to assist a small business owner of a welding company by keeping track of projects, locations of projects and progress of projects. HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript were used to help create the applicaiton and dynamically display project name, status, location and overall progress. Future goals of this project are to have the map display all locations and markers at one time, be able to add notes and other pertinent information to the projects using modals and make display more user friendly for mobile applications.

Installation

A web browser such as Google Ch!rome, Internet Explorer, Safari or Firefox is needed to run the application.

The application can be accessed via the following link: https://kevinserrano.github.io/Project1Week7/

Usage

The application page has two entry fields in which a project name and address may be entered. Once a project is added, the address of the project will display in the Location section. The project name and a series of buttons will display in the list section. As items are added to the list, the progress chart will automatically update to indicate the status as incomplete. Complete, inprogress, incomplete and location buttons will appear next to the project name in the list. These buttons may be used to update the project status and also redisplay the location of the project in the map. Projects, their status and address will persist in the page, even upon refreshing.

Usage is demonstrated via the gif below:
